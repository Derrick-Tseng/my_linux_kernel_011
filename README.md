# MyLinux-0.11
A simple operating system kernel for the i386 architecture, based on the original Linux 0.11.

The primary goal of this repository is to document my journey of learning the fundamentals of operating systems and the Linux kernel by reading the book 《從零開始寫Linux內核》.

The development is done in a M1 Mac using qemu, with cross-compilation for i386 using x86_64-elf toolchain.

## Current Features
- Bootloader
- Console
- printk
